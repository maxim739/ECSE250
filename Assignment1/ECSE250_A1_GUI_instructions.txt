We have provided a GUI that you can use to test your game once you've written all the classes. 
Put the files BeeColony.java, Map.java, and GameCanvas.java in the same folder as your assignment code. 
You can configure various parameters (health, attack power, etc.) by changing the static attributes in BeeColony. 
When you run the main method in BeeColony, a game board should pop up.

To use the GUI, press the "start game" button. The yellow tile on the left is a beehive and the red tile on the right is a hornet nest. 
The game automatically progresses in turns, and each turn the takeAction() method is called for all of the insects on the board. 
You can add one or many hornets to the nest by clicking the "spawn hornet" button. 
You can add the various types of bees to any tile by clicking the button for the bee followed by the tile you want it to be on. 
Note that there will be a slight delay of up to 5 seconds when adding bees or hornets before you see them on the screen. 
Each turn, log messages will print to give you information about what's happening in your game.

Have fun, and feel free to update the code for the GUI to add more log messages, change the board configuration, etc.
