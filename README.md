# ECSE250
All of these projects were made as assignments for my ECSE250 - Introduction to Software Development at McGill University

The code was structured for the assignments by the TAs/Professor, but most of the functionality and methods are written by me.

## Assignment 1
For this assignment, we had to write the methods for a basic game where Bees and Hornets fought each other. This was a very good introduction to Object-Oriented Programing for me because there are many classes that all refrence each other, and there are many types of Bees and Hornets that all inherit traits from each other.

## Assignment 2
This project encodes and decodes messages with solitaire and a one time pad. There are many methods here that were used to encrypt and decrypt messages.

## Assignment 3
This is my best project to come out of this class. This is a visual game where players try to get a high score by orienting blocks to maximize either the number of one color on the perimiter of a square, or to maximize the number of squares of the same color touching each other. I learned a lot about coding on this project.
There is a lot of structure code provided by the TAs of the course that was written to create the GUI for the project, but all of the game's functional methods were written by me.
